      "Individuals around today's world utilize an increasing portion of their daily lives online. Activities\n",
      "involved exhibit trends of human behavior about interactions. The interactions leave behind\n",
      "information on account of social and political engagements in society. Social media interactions\n",
      "contemplate incomparable data regarding what the organization and its individuals hold vital\n",
      "(Hargittai, 2018). Big data, therefore, represents the magnitude of knowledge and its quick flow, as\n",
      "seen on social media platforms. Most big data researches rely on people's opinions on social media\n",
      "acts. Analysts consider these platforms to offer different priorities to persons from diverse\n",
      "backgrounds. Studies exhibit that individuals from more advanced socioeconomic classes tend to\n",
      "appear on several sites. Opposite to significant data initiatives, such findings establish that social\n",
      "sites of media outline information linked to the privileged in society (Hargittai, 2018). On account of\n",
      "big data, it is therefore not advisable to rely on details from these platforms as a single site for data\n",
      "collection. Therefore, social media constitutes websites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter in\n",
      "generating a large volume of data within a scaled short period.\n",

      "‘were linked to the most privileged community in society (Hargittai, 2018). People considered to\n",
      "generate higher income were fond of using Twitter and Linkedin. Therefore, it remains\n",
      "inappropriate to dorive big data from social media due to the fact people from different ethnic\n",
      "groups are involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collection of data on specific platforms imposes danger provided there exists a gap in the\n",
      "information generated. Analysts set Facebook as an example of a biased platform. Researchers took\n",
      "into account that most recruits to Facebook were either higher educated, whites, or those who\n",
      "earned a higher income. Persons taking a survey on these platforms should, therefore, take into\n",
      "consideration the reliability of data gathered - more challenges set in for corporations relying on big\n",
      "data defined by social network platforms (Hargittai, 2018). On account of Twitter, the data outlined\n",

      "Big data represents a tremendous opportunity for companies, as it can help to make better decisions\n",
      "in an operational, tactical and strategic level (Schroeck, Shockley, Smart, Romero-Morales, & Tufano,\n",
      "2012), with direct impact on business profitability (Waller & Fawcett, 2013). The ability to draw\n",
      "insights from different types of data creates huge value for a firm (Dijcks, 2013; Kiron & Shockley,\n",
      "2015). Big data presents a far greater opportunity than what is being utilized. Only 0.5% of big data\n",
      "is being utilized and analysed while there is potential for so much more (Guess, 2015). Bearing in\n",
      "mind this huge potential, literature providing empirical evidence of the business value added by big\n",
      "data analytics in a supply chain remains little and even poor (Wamba, 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "All supply chain operations and activities are set in motion by the final customers’ demand\n",
      "(Syntetos et al., 2016). Demand forecasting is used as a basis to make supply chain strategy (Marshall,\n",
      "Dockendorff, & Ibafiez, 2013) and forecasting weaknesses is one of the main reasons for supply chain\n",
      "failures (Zadeh, Sepehri, & Farvaresh, 2014), Demand Forecasting can be improved significantly by\n",
      "using big data (Chao, 2015), especially the big data from social media (Arias, Arratia, & Xuriguera,\n",
      "2014). With an increase in social media activity, there has been an emergence of academic and\n",
      "industrial research that taps into these social media data sources. However, the utilization of these\n",
      "data sources remain at an early stage and outcomes are often mixed (Yu, Duan, & Cao, 2013)\n",
