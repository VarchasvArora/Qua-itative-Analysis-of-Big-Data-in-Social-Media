Break every time you drop them. And i was very confident about my insights so i was very excited to share them with nokia. The nokia was not convinced. Because it wasn't big data. Is that we have millions of data points and we don't see any indicators of anyone wanting to buy a smartphone. And your data set of 100 hours as it is two week for a second take seriously. Write a note to your right of course you want to see. Because you know you are sending your service is swimming that people don't know what is smartphone into years. Your service your message has been designed to optimise an existing business model and i am looking at these emerging human dynamics have been happened. Do you know what happens in nokia. Their business fell off a cliff. This is the cost of missing something. It was unforgettable. All the time because it didn't come from. It's not big data is false. If the way we use big data it's our responsibility. Big data reputation for success comes from quantifying very specific environment. One more quantifying in systems are more less contain. Winner of systems are nearly contained when your quantifying in systems are more dynamic especially systems involved human beings. Forces are complex and unpredictable and these are things that we don't. Once you predict something about human behaviour. New factors emer. You think you know something and then something unknown enters the picture. And that's why just relying on big data alone increases the chance that will miss something. For giving us this illusion. We are you know everything. Make some really hard to. See this paradox and even. Quantification by. Which is the unconscious belief of valuing the measurable over the measure. Even when you present them evidence right in front of their face. And this is a very appealing message. There's nothing wrong with quantifying it's actually very satisfying me. Get a great sense of comfort from looking at an excel spreadsheet. Everything is under control. The problem is. The quantifying is adjective. It's very easy to just draw a data because it can be expressed as a numerical value is very easy to slip into silver bullet thinking as if some simple solution existed. This is a great moment of danger for any organisation. It isn't in the hashtag. What is the tornado that bring down on its outside of the bar. There is no greater risk can be applied to the. Something big. We don't have to go down this path. Who is the secret ke. Now recent physiological research has shown that the temple of apollo where the most famous for. Earth crust and the oracle literally sports in healing enormous amount of ethylene gas these features. It's ok. So how. Did anyone how did anyone get any useful voice in this state. Who is the chief of surrounding the oracle is serious people holding her up because you like inside holding the orange no book. Photos of the temple guys and they were hand in hand with the work. When increased to work. Why do you want to know this property who are you what you want to do with this information. And then the temple guides which is more effective graphic the small qualitative information and interpreter. Stand alone and neither should are big data systems. Predictions. What i am saying is. In the same way that the oracle needed for temple gu. They need people like if not refers to user researcher. This is precious data from human. Stories emotions interaction. Cannot be quantified collected for nokia very small sample size. Particulars incredible depth of meaning. And what makes it so sick and midi. Is the experience of understanding the human nar. Victory grounds or business questions in human questions. And that's why. Integrating big and big data forms a more complete picture. Scale and laboratory best of machine intelligence. Can help us rescue the context class. The best of human intelligence. You can also work with data that hasn't been collected you can ask questions about why. Why is this happening. Netflix status from the business. None of this is known for their really great recommendation algorithm. And they have this 1 million dollar price for anyone who could improve. And their winners. Improvements for only incremental. Create my crack. They hadn't seen initially in the quantitative data. He discovered the people love to binge watching in fact. Into with the quantitative data. Net. Decided to do something very simple. Play im. Instead of offering. The same show from different genres or most of the differences from similar users. Your experience to really encourage bench watching. Why people in french disappear for whole weekends at a time catching up and shows like masters of. Only improve the business. How we consume media and now. Their stocks are projected to double the next few years. This isn't just about you know watch more videos or selling more smartphones. Inaugurating dictator insights into the algorithm could mean life or death. Especially for the marginalized. All around the country please departments are using big data for predictive policing. Recommendations in ways that reinforce existing bias. Nss skynet machine learning algorithm. As all of our lives to convert automated. Employment. It is likely that all of. Movie impacted by the quantification by. Have a good news is that we come a long way from having a feeling gas to make predictions we have better tools so let's just using that. What's innovative big data with spring companies or non profits or government or even in the software. All the matters. Picture means what collectively committed to making better algorithm better decisions. This is how avoid missing. That's something. \n",
